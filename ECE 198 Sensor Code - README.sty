Over the last century, the issue of global warming and its long-term ramifications on society has stood 
center stage at the heart of human initiatives in all industries alike. For those living below the 
poverty line, the amalgamation of their reliance on scarcely available natural resources and their lack 
of infrastructure puts them in an unfavourable  position to address the rapidly shifting global 
temperatures. Hence, it becomes increasingly important to utilize technology as a means to better the 
lives of those living in poverty; not because we can aid in the avoidance of the effects of global 
warming, but rather, to equip them with the knowledge needed. 

It is with the aforementioned consideration that our group is creating a product that detects the 
potential probability of heat waves in the atmosphere by analyzing air humidity, temperature, and 
barometric air pressure. After analyzing this data, our product will display a course of action that 
will indicate what the user can do to avoid potential dehydration or other harmful effects. 

Our project will, by taking various readings, will create an index score for the atmosphere that it is
placed in: based upon the magnitude of the severity of the index score, individuals will be notified 
to take actions including but not limited to drinking a specific number of quarts of water, obtaining
shelter where the materials of the shelter do not magnify the heat, etc. For individuals that 
currently lack proper resources or devices to measure whether or not there is a heat wave occurring, 
this could be pivotal in saving them from all of the health ramifications stemming from heat waves. 
For instance, if they had priorly thought that that was simply an increase in heat due to season and 
not a heat wave, they could have the potential of suffering respiratory and cardiovascular diseases: 
however, our product could mitigate that possibility. 

Heat waves in developing countries have remained a persistent problem due to their lack of 
infrastructure and development: individuals have to walk for long periods in complete exposure to 
sunlight, simply to obtain necessities like water. This is especially in the African continent, where 
a history of government health agencies and other weather entities have notoriously not reported the 
heat waves that are occurring. As noted by an article by the University of Oxford, there have been 
"just two heatwaves in sub-Saharan Africa... listed in the last 120 years in the Emergency Events 
Database (EM-DAT)...the most comprehensive catalogue of the impacts of extreme weather events 
globally.", despite a United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction report asserting that there 
have been "12,000 and 19,000 heat-related child deaths per year in Africa". The latter statistic fails
to not only account for age groups other than adults but also does not account for the deaths that 
were not reported, meaning that the numbers are probably even greater in magnitude. The article by 
the University of Oxford also attributes the issues with heat wave detection, and thus heat-related 
deaths, to "the sparsity of meteorological data, weaker governance frameworks and lack of institutional 
resources, which our project could theoretically solve.  Suppose they knew that there was a heat wave 
incoming, which could be done through our heat wave detection product. In that case, they could 
hypothetically plan, and save themselves from the dangers associated with potential dehydration. Also, 
the people in these regions have a larger challenge with addressing climate change because oftentimes 
houses in poor neighbourhoods are built with cement, with a zinc or tin roof. However, all of the 
listed materials have a nature of absorbing heat which ramifies in poorer individuals struggling even 
more with the negative consequences of heatwaves. 

The files in this repository serve as the code for the sensor in order that the sensors will be able to
detect the levels of humidity as well as temperature in order to determine whether or not the area that 
is being tracked is under a heat wave or not. Then we will display the information on a display screen
so that the area being tested will known what actions are needed to be taken for their own security.
